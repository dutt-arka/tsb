						<h3><center>Our Activities in Tripura</center></h3>
					</div>

						<p>We have floated Expression of Interest seeking applications from the Wards of the Covid -19 orphans from the families belonging to the marginalized section of society for continuance of their studies till the level of graduation or for a period of 5 years, whichever is less in collaboration with the Tata AIG General Insurance Company. <strong>It is a first time initiative of the Tripura State Branch.</strong></p>
						<p>We have arranged accommodation for the people belonging to the marginalized section of society for short duration stay in the Red Cross Society facilities in Chennai at a 50% discount rate in the face of the fact that large number of people quite often visits Hospitals in Chennai for availing of tertiary medical care for their family members. This arrangement made with the help of the Tamilnadu Red Cross has been a hugely popular and successful initiative.</p>
						<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;">COVID-19 RELIEF</span></h2>
						<img src = "images/act1.jpg" align ="right">
						<ul>
						<li>We have allowed the Tripura Medical College (TMC) &amp; Dr. BRAM Teaching hospital at Agartala (Declared as the dedicated Covid-19 hospital) to use one of our ambulances for ferrying patients during this period of pandemic who are escorted to Agartala by train for better treatment.</li>
						<li>25 of the 40 Oxygen Concentrator machines received as gift from the Oppo Cell phone Company were handed over to the Tripura Medical College authorities for emergency use by the Covid-19 patients admitted in to the said Hospital which was declared as the dedicated Covid -19 Hospital of Tripura.</li>
